    "In my Blackjack game, I am building a **simple but realistic 1-player vs dealer** version that runs in the console. I use a **standard 52-card deck**, and each card is represented as a tuple such as **(\"A\", \"♠\")** or **(\"10\", \"♥\")**. This allows the game to display real cards clearly while still calculating points accurately. At the beginning of each round, the program creates the full deck, shuffles it, and deals cards by removing them from the deck using `.pop()`, ensuring that no card is repeated during the same round.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the player’s hand and the dealer’s hand are stored as **lists**, since cards will be added throughout the round. To calculate the total value of a hand, each card rank is converted into its Blackjack value (**2–10 keep their number, J/Q/K = 10, Ace = 11**). All values are summed, and then Aces are adjusted dynamically. If the total exceeds 21 and the hand contains Aces counted as 11, the program reduces the value of one or more Aces from **11 to 1** by subtracting 10 until the total is safe or no Aces remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "During gameplay, the program displays the player’s full hand and total, while only one of the dealer’s cards is shown at first to keep the game realistic. The player can choose to **hit** or **stand**, and a loop continues until the player stands or goes over 21. After the player’s turn ends, the dealer plays automatically following standard Blackjack rules and must hit until reaching at least 17, using the same Ace-adjustment logic. Finally, the program compares both totals, announces the result (win, loss, bust, or tie), and asks the user if they want to play another round, repeating the process inside the main game loop.\n",
