    "## ♠️ Improved Blackjack Strategy (Console, 1 Player vs Dealer)\n",
    "\n",
    "This Blackjack project simulates a **simple but realistic console game** where one player competes against the dealer using a **standard 52-card deck**. The goal is to practice core programming concepts such as **functions, lists, loops, conditionals, and user input**, while following real Blackjack rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of each round, the program creates and shuffles a full deck of 52 cards. Each card is represented as a **tuple containing its rank and suit**, such as `(\\\"A\\\", \\\"♠\\\")` or `(\\\"10\\\", \\\"♥\\\")`. Cards are removed from the deck when dealt to ensure that no card is repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the player and the dealer receive two cards at the start of the round. Hands are stored in **lists**, since cards will be added dynamically when a player or the dealer chooses to hit. Card values follow standard Blackjack rules: number cards keep their value, face cards are worth 10, and Aces are worth 11 or 1 depending on the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle Aces correctly, the program first counts all Aces as 11. If the total value of a hand exceeds 21, the value of one or more Aces is reduced from 11 to 1 until the hand is valid or no Aces remain. This prevents unnecessary busts and mirrors real Blackjack behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the **player’s turn**, the program displays the player’s full hand and total, while showing only **one visible card from the dealer**. The player can choose to **hit** (receive another card) or **stand** (end their turn). The turn continues until the player stands or busts.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the **dealer’s turn**, the dealer reveals their full hand and automatically draws cards until their total reaches **17 or higher**. The same Ace-adjustment logic applies to the dealer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once both turns are complete, the program compares totals and determines the outcome: player win, dealer win, bust, or tie. At the end of the round, the player is asked whether they want to play again, allowing the game to repeat in a loop.\n"
